### Digital Ocean (The developer cloud).

* Where I'm hosting my wiki (I also have it hosted on netlify).
* I created an application (with my github account as the source) by using the bottom of this article:
  * <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-and-deploy-a-hugo-site-to-digitalocean-app-platform>
* The process was easy, it just pointed to the github account and repository. 
* It detected that my repository was a hugo site and did everything for me.
* It took a while to build/deploy. Thats fine because I don't need to watch it build. I can develop locally and get it right, then start a build when I'm done.
* Url to wiki:
  * <https://wiki-3acuc.ondigitalocean.app/>
