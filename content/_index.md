* Disclaimer: These wiki pages are my notes. They are not exhaustive or complete. They are to help me remember stuff I frequently reach for or google.
* If you find these pages useful, cool.
* The secondary goal for this wiki was to learn the Hugo framework using markdown and deploy to Netlify. This site is the result of that effort.
* My apologies if they aren't useful for you.
* I plan to continue to capture a lot of useful tips and examples that I care about in this wiki.
* These instructions are for a windows based development environment.
