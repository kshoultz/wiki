* I want to keep the architecture as simple as possible.
* I want the database, backend, and frontend choices to be a clean separate implementation.
* If a framework choice is changed, I want the least resistance in making the architecture change.
* When writing code, stay within the intent of the framework as much as possible:
  * Reduces developer code error.
  * Increases maintainability.
  * Keeps code upgradable.
  * Allows for other developers to follow and consume your code.
