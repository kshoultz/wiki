* I have the hugo environment set up on my main machine. I'd like to capture this process in the wiki.
* I have only the github repository on my laptop. I can make content changes from the laptop.
* I only have one Hugo site. I want to revisit the installation and see if I can have the Hugo sites in my main workspace with other framework sites.
* My theme for this wiki is a submodule. I'd like for it to be a copy, so that I can modify the theme.
