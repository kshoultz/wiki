### Common Environment Setup Tips

* Learn to properly set up your system environment variables. Most commonly it will be the PATH variable.
* Keep your download software installed to the Program Files directory. You don't want your root cluttered.
* Start documenting your process. You'll thank yourself next year when things change. 
* If you're a web developer, I'd suggest creating a wiki documentation site similar to this one. It will make it more interesting and fun to document (speaking from experience).
