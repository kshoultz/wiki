### Setup and Configuration

* The latest version of Python as of this wiki is 3.8.1
* HOWEVER, when installing Node.js, it will install Python 2.7.17, so still figuring this one out.
* Node.js uses Python 2.7.17 to compile some of the assets.
* If you are using Node.js, you  may just want to install Python for you instead.
* If you're not using Node.js, download and install the latest version of Python so that you can develop Python applications.
* Be sure python is accurately in the Path variable.
* Checking version: python -v

### Visual Studio Code Extensions

* Python (ms-python.python)

### Python Notes

I currently don't develop websites on Python or Django. I do however keep brushed up on the language. It is good for machine learning purposes.
