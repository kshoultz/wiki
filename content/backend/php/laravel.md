### Laravel Notes

## Create the Vue Scaffolding

* composer laravel/ui --dev
* php artisan ui vue
* npm install (installs the vue and node packages)
* npm run dev (builds the Vue files)
* These files are deployed to the public directory
* You will need to tie the vue framework to the blade and implementation. See the Vue wiki.
* php artisan serve
