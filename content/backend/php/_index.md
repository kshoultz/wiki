### Setup and Configuration

* Download and install the latest version of PHP.
* I want my root directory to be clean, so I install to "C:\Program Files\php-7.3.11".
* Checking version: php -v
* Be sure php is in the Path variable.
* When I moved my php directory on my laptop, for some reason the php.ini got lost.
* I tried a lot of things, but what ultimately worked was to re-run the composer setup executable. It asked if I wanted to create a php.ini file, which is what I was trying to figure out.

### Visual Studio Code Extensions

* Laravel Blade Spacer
* Laravel Blade Snippets
* Laravel goto view
* PHP DocBlocker
* PHP Getters & Setters
