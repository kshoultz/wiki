### Setup and Configuration

* Download and install the latest version of PHP.
* I want my root directory to be clean, so I install to "C:\Program Files\php-7.3.11".
* Checking version: php -v
* Be sure php is in the Path variable.
* When I moved my php directory on my laptop, for some reason the php.ini got lost. I had to do the following command:
* setx PHPRC "C:\YourPathto\PHP7\php.ini"
